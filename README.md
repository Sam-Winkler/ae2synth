# ae2synth

AE2Synth is the easy way to send your shot from After Effects to Syntheyes. Press the "Send" button and Syntheyes will open with the footage ready to track. If you'd like to automatically have a hi-pass filter applied for easier tracking, that's possible too. And you can save your favorite hi-pass preset so your shots always have it applied on import.
